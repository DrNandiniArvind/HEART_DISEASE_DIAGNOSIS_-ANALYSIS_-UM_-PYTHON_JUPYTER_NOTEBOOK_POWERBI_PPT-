# HEART_DISEASE_DIAGNOSIS_-ANALYSIS_-UM_-PYTHON_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_POWERBI_PPT-

**Problem Statement:**
- Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status.
- You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation.
- Do ETL: Extract- Transform and Load data from the heart disease diagnostic database
- You can perform EDA through python. The database extracts various information such as Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.
- You can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information.
- Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data.
- Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard
- Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.


**conclusion:**
- This project provided valuable insights into heart disease risk factors by leveraging Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.
- It enhanced my ability to perform exploratory data analysis, identify critical predictors like chest pain type and cholesterol levels, and develop targeted health strategies.
- Additionally, creating an interactive Power BI dashboard further strengthened my skills in presenting actionable insights for early diagnosis and effective monitoring of heart health.


**Deliverables Expected:**
- Python Notebook: A comprehensive Python notebook showcasing relationships, predictions, and evaluation.
- Dashboard: An interactive dashboard created using Power BI.
- Presentation: A PowerPoint report featuring graphs, insights, and actionable recommendations.
